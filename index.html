        <h1>Diploma Inflation in China: Why young people feel involution while undergraduate rate is only 7%?</h1>

        <p>Involution, the opposite of envolution, is a popular word in Chinese social media, especially among young students. It refers to the fierce competition in labour markets and in the education system, and is a central part of the debate around China's hyper-competitive culture. It describes the feeling of burnout, ennui, and despair, according to a writer for <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/chinas-involuted-generation">New Yorker</a>.</p>
        <p>Chinese undergraduate students are facing pressures -  and they don't seem to live in a society with only 7% undergraduate rates. They are supposed to enjoy the privilege of being "one in a hundred"; however in fact, most find that their undergraduate degree is not a garantee for a good job. Are the statistics deceiving them? Or is there another reason?</p>
        <p>This is why I take a look at the education data in China.</p>

        <p>If you were born in 1970 like my mother, you will be the top 2% of the peers if you got admitted by a college.</p>

        <p>As it shows in the chart above, if taking the population group with the same age as the denominator rather than the entire population, the actual peer group undergraduate rate in China has skyrocketed over the last three decades.</p>

        <p>It is difficult to evaluate the impact of the surge in the number of college students in China from a historical perspective, at least not from these simple charts. What we can tell is that the diploma inflation is affecting China's younger generation. Their parents may still live in days when an academic certificate can be exchanged for a secure job. But now it's a different era.</p>
